    "This guide adresses beginner DeepLabCut users (e.g. undergraduate students with little to no experience with operating python) and serves as an introduction to using DeepLabCut for video-based pose estimation. It follows the standard DeepLabCut workflow which was introduced by [Nath et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-019-0176-0) in one of the DeepLabCut key publications.\n",

    "I am an undergraduate neuroscience student who recently came into contact with machine-learning based tools for markerless pose estimation, namely _DeepLabCut_.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to create this beginner friendly DeepLabCut guide for people who (like me) have litte experience with Python or using the command line and who want to learn how to use this helpful tool in a simple hands-on project.\n",

    "## What is DeepLabCut?\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepLabCut is a python toolbox designed for markerless pose estimation of animals and is developed by the team of the [Mathis lab](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) of adaptive motor control. It is a video-based approach, meaning that users input video files and DeepLabCut outputs the positions of all tracked body parts for every frame of the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, DeepLabCut utilizes a supervised machine learning algorithm. In practice, this means that frames are extracted from a video and manually labeled (= the user marks the points of interest to be tracked on each frame). These labeled frames are then used to train a neural network that can eventually recognize and label the defined points of interest on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting network (namely a DeepLabCut model) can be used to analyze new videos with respect to tracking the same points of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of DeepLabCut can be tricky when you are doing it for the first time. Since DeeplabCut is not yet one of the end-user optimized programs as one is used to, it has to be installed via the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do so is by following the [step by step instructions](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html) provided by the DeepLabCut developers. Simply start with the CONDA section and follow along beginning with _Step 1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you will have to execute the following steps:\n",

    ":::{admonition} üßê Student's note\n",
    ":class: seealso\n",
    "You can customize the name of your virtual DeepLabCut environment by opening the Installation File and changing the `name` variable (e.g. to \"DLC\" instead of \"DEEPLABCUT\") _before_ creating the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![EditInstallationFile](Figures/F1.PNG)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "::::\n",
    "1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). (üí° That's a distribution platform for the Python programming language.)\n",
    "2. Download the DeepLabCut [Installation File](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/s/DEEPLABCUT.yaml).\n",
    "3. Open Anaconda Prompt. (üí° That's a command line application which was installed together with Anaconda.)\n",
    "4. Change directory to the directory where the installation file was saved (e.g. in Anaconda Prompt type `cd Downloads`).\n",
    "5. Create a virtual environment from the installation file. (Type <code> conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml</code>; üí° This will install DeepLabCut and all its dependencies.)\n",
    "6. Activate the environment. (Type <code> conda activate DEEPLABCUT</code>)\n",

    "\n",
    "That's it. After completing the installation, the real DeepLabCutting can begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do I need a GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "Training an artificial neural network (ANN) using DeepLabCut recquires a lot of computational power. Therefore, the DeepLabCut developers strongly recommend using a GPU for training the model but also for video analysis.\n",
    "Although it is technically possible to train and analyze on a CPU, in practice this isn't practible, since even on a GPU the analysis can take several days to weeks (depending on the number and size of videos).\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes, you may need a GPU in order to train an ANN and to analyze videos using a trained network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to run DeepLabCut on a cloud-based computing platform, such as Google colab (that provides free GPU access). See the DeepLabCut [GitHub](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/README.md) repository for more information on this option. However, in my experience, the amount of time you get access to a GPU using this option is often not enough to train a model sufficiently.\n",
    "\n",

Setting this parameter to 'False' will lead to the creation of symbolic links to the videos.

However, if you want to move or rename the original video files after the project has been created, I recommend setting it to 'True'.)\n",

The total number of labeled frames will later make up the size of your training dataset. There is no fixed specification on how large the training dataset should be (as this largely depends on your amount of videos, video quality, number of included animals, ...). However, the general rule is: the bigger, the better. For a start, I would aim for a size of at least 200 frames. Therefore, only adapt this parameter if you have a whole lot of videos. Otherwise, just leave it as it is for now.\n",
