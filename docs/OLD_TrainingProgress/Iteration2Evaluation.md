# Evaluation: iteration-2
:::{note}
This jupyter book is a work in progress. This page will shortly be extended.
:::

The results for the third training iteration (iteration 2) are summarized below.  
For all experimental setups/video types, a few test and training frames are pictured in the following tables.

:::{note}
Labeling results are depicted acording to this scheme:  
“+”: Original markers set by the human scorer,  
“x” : Markers computed by the model, label accuracy < …% ,  
“dot”: Markers computed by the model, label accuracy > …

The frames were trimmed, focusing on the pigeon, and excluding the experimental surrounding.
